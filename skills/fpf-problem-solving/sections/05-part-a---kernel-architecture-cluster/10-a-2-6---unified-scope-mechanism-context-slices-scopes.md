## A.2.6 - Unified Scope Mechanism (USM): Context Slices & Scopes
> **Status:** Stable
> **Type:** Ontic pattern


### A.2.6:0.1 - Kind Settlement

`U.ContextSlice` and `U.Scope` are the durable USM values for scope work. `U.ClaimScope`, `U.WorkScope`, and `U.PublicationScope` are C.3-governed scope specializations under `U.Scope`, not independent root ontics. `ContextSliceSet` is the set-valued scope value over addressable `U.ContextSlice`s, not an independent root kind. `GammaTimePolicy`, work-measure target sets, qualification-window policies, formality thresholds, detail values, abstraction-tier values, scope profiles, coverage metrics, guards, reports, and publication views remain policy values, characteristic values, non-U records, lenses, guard facets, or publication forms unless a direct governing pattern admits them. Dotted forms such as `U.Mechanism.Intension` name the intension slot or intension form governed by `U.Mechanism` and A.6.1; they do not admit a separate structural U-kind.

> **One-line summary.** Introduces a single, context-local **scope mechanism** for all holons: **`U.ContextSlice`** (where we reason and measure) and a family of **set-valued scope types** (**USM scope objects, `U.Scope`**), specialized as **`U.ClaimScope`** for epistemes (**G** in **F–G–R**), **`U.WorkScope`** for system capabilities, and **`U.PublicationScope`** for publication carriers; with one algebra (intersection, SpanUnion, translate, widen, narrow, and refit) and uniform Cross-context handling through Bridge and CL.

**Use this pattern when** a project must decide where a claim holds, where a capability can deliver work, or where a publication surface is admissible across concrete context slices.
**What goes wrong if missed.** Applicability, envelope, generality, validity, capability envelope, and publication applicability start acting like separate mechanisms; teams widen scope by wording, compose unsupported slices, or move claims across contexts without Bridge and CL loss.

**What this buys.** Scope becomes one set-valued mechanism over addressable `U.ContextSlice`s, with carrier-specific specializations for claims, work, and publications and one algebra for intersection, SpanUnion, translation, widening, narrowing, and refit.

**Vocabulary boundary.** Use these scope names in live FPF wording:


* For epistemes, the only **scope type** is **`U.ClaimScope`** (nick **G** in F–G–R).
* For system capabilities, the only **scope type** is **`U.WorkScope`**.
* For publication carriers (views, cards, and lanes), the only **scope type** is **`U.PublicationScope`**.
* The abstract architectural notion is **`U.Scope`** — a **set-valued USM object** over `ContextSliceSet` with its own algebra: intersection, SpanUnion, translate, widen, narrow, and refit. It is **not** a `U.Characteristic` and MUST NOT appear in any `CharacteristicSpace`.

Source words such as *applicability*, *envelope*, *generality*, and *capability envelope* may appear only as explanatory aliases in non-normative notes.

**Cross‑references.**
— **C.2.3** (Unified Formality **F**) and **C.2.2** (F–G–R): this pattern **defines G** as `U.ClaimScope`.
— **A.2.2** (Capabilities): capability gating now **SHALL** use `U.WorkScope`.
— **Part B** (Bridges and CL): Cross‑context transfers **MUST** declare a Bridge with **CL**; CL affects **R**, not **F/G**.
— **Part E** (Publication discipline; e.g., **E.17 MVPK**): publication views, cards, and lanes MAY declare `U.PublicationScope` to bound **where** a publication is admissible; `U.PublicationScope` MUST NOT widen the underlying `U.ClaimScope`/`U.WorkScope`. (USM supplies the scope calculus; Part E supplies publication discipline.)

### A.2.6:1 - Problem frame - Purpose and Audience

This pattern gives **engineering managers and assurance architects** one vocabulary, one model, and one set of operations to talk about **where** a claim holds and **under which conditions** a system can deliver a piece of **Work**. It removes the need to remember whether a document said “applicability,” a model said “envelope,” or a safety plan said “capability envelope.” **Scope is scope.** The only distinction that matters is **what carries it**:

* **Knowledge and episteme claims** → **Claim scope** (G).
* **System capability claims** → **Work scope** (conditions under which Work at the promised measures is deliverable).

With USM, teams can:

* specify, compare, and compose scope **without translation games**;
* gate ESG and Method–Work steps with **observable, context‑local scope checks**;
* cross Contexts safely using Bridges and **explicit CL penalties** applied to **R**.

This pattern **defines** the **scope mechanism** (Context slices, set‑valued scopes, algebra, and guard usage) and the canonical **lexicon** (Claim scope (G), Work scope). It does **not** prescribe which Contexts must widen or narrow scope, nor which assurance levels are required; those are set by context‑local ESG and Method–Work policies, which SHALL reference the mechanisms defined here.

### A.2.6:2 - Context

#### A.2.6:2.1 - Cross‑disciplinary pressures

Modern projects couple **formal specs**, **data‑driven models**, **safety cases**, and **operational playbooks**. Each specification, model, safety case, or operational-playbook publication must say **where it is valid**—yet terminology drifts:

* Standards and specs often say *applicability* or *scope*.
* Modeling communities say *envelope*.
* Safety and performance documents speak about *capability envelope*.
* Knowledge patterns have used *generality* (G) as if it were “more abstract,” when we actually need “**where the statement holds**.”

#### A.2.6:2.2 - context‑local reasoning

FPF is context‑local: decisions, checks, and state assertions are **valid inside a bounded context**. Every practical question—*Is this claim usable here? Can this capability deliver that Work now?*—must be answered **on a concrete slice of context** (terminology, versions, environmental parameters, time selector **Γ\_time**). USM provides a first‑class object for such slices and a single scope calculus atop them.

#### A.2.6:2.3 - Minimal, composable trust math

In **F–G–R**:

* **F** (formality) is “how strictly a claim is expressed” (C.2.3).
* **G** must be “**where it holds**,” not “how abstract it sounds.”
* **R** measures evidence and decays/penalties (freshness, CL).

When **G** is a **set‑valued scope**, composition becomes precise: serial dependencies **intersect** scopes; parallel, independently supported lines can publish a **SpanUnion**—but only where each line is supported.

### A.2.6:3 - Problem

1. **Synonym soup.** *Applicability, envelope, generality, capability envelope*—different labels for the **same mechanism** led to mismatches in gating, review, and reuse.
2. **Abstraction confusion.** Calling G “generality” invited teams to treat “more abstract wording” as “broader scope,” silently masking unstated assumptions.
3. **Split mechanics.** Episteme vs system text used different algebra and guard language, though **the same set operations** were meant.
4. **Cross‑context opacity.** Transfers between Contexts lacked a shared carrier and a rule for what changes (trust) vs what stays (scope).
5. **Overloaded words.** *Validity* clashed with **Validation Assurance (LA)**; *operation* and *operational* clashed with **Work** and **Run** in A.15, producing governance ambiguity.

### A.2.6:4 - Forces

| Force                                             | Tension to resolve                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **One mechanism vs two worlds**                   | We must serve both **knowledge about the world** (claims) and **doing work in the world** (capabilities) **without** duplicating concepts.                       |
| **Locality vs interoperability**                  | Scope must be **context‑local** and precisely checkable, yet transferable across Contexts via Bridges **without redefining** the characteristic.                       |
| **Expressivity vs minimal vocabulary**            | Teams need to capture rich conditions (time windows, environment, versions) but not explode the lexicon into variants such as “envelope”, “applicability”, or “generality”.                |
| **Static content vs operational change**          | Claims may hold broadly while current operations are narrow (or vice versa). The mechanism must keep “what is true” and “what can be done” aligned yet distinct. |
| **Open‑world exploration vs closed‑world gating** | Exploration benefits from permissive drafts; **gates** require crisp, observable checks. The same scope object must support both.                                |

### A.2.6:5 - Solution - Overview

**USM** introduces:

* **`U.ContextSlice`** — an addressable **slice of a bounded context** (terminology, parameter ranges, versions/Standards, and a mandatory **Γ\_time** selector). All scope checks are performed **on slices**.
* **`U.Scope`** — the abstract **set‑valued scope object** over `U.ContextSlice`.
* **Specializations:**
  **`U.ClaimScope`** (nick **G**) on `U.Episteme` (“**where the claim holds**”),
  **`U.WorkScope`** on `U.Capability` (“**where the capability can deliver Work at declared measures within qualification windows**”), and
  **`U.PublicationScope`** on publication carriers (“**where the publication surface is admissible**”).
* **One algebra:** serial **intersection**, parallel **SpanUnion** (only where independently supported), **translate** via Bridge (CL affects **R**, not **F/G**), and **widen**, **narrow**, and **refit** operations for scope evolution.

**Lexical commitments (normative):**
— In normative text and guards, use **Claim scope (G)**, **Work scope**, and **Publication scope**.
— Do **not** name the scope object “applicability”, “envelope”, “generality”, “capability envelope”, “publication applicability”, or “validity.” Those words are permitted only as explanatory aliases in notes.

### A.2.6:6 - Normative Definitions

#### A.2.6:6.0 - USM as a `U.Mechanism.Intension` (normalization for A.6.1/A.6.5)

**Intent.** This subsection makes the **USM** definition in A.2.6 explicitly conform to the
`U.Mechanism` *intension* requirements (A.6.1) and the `…Slot` / `…Ref` lexical discipline (A.6.5),
without changing USM’s meaning.

**USM Mechanism.Intension (normative; A.6.1 decomposition).**

* **Imports (USM).** `U.ContextSlice`, `ContextSliceSet`, Part B **Bridge and CL** (`U.Bridge`, `U.CongruenceLevel`), and `GammaTimePolicy`.
* **RangedValueKind (USM).** `ContextSliceSet` (set-valued scope objects range over sets of addressable `U.ContextSlice`).
* **SliceSet (USM).** `ContextSliceSet` (addressable `U.ContextSlice`s; see §6.1).
* **SubjectKind (USM).** `U.Scope` with kind specialisations:
  `U.ClaimScope ⊑ U.Scope`, `U.WorkScope ⊑ U.Scope`, `U.PublicationScope ⊑ U.Scope`.
* **ExtentRule (USM).** The quantifier domain is the set of **well‑formed scope objects** over the SliceSet: `Extension(U.Scope, slice) = { S | S subsetOf ContextSliceSet }`.
* **ResultKind? (USM).** `U.Scope` (for operators that return scopes, e.g., `∩`, `SpanUnion`, `translate`).

**SlotIndex (USM) for operators/guards (normative; A.6.0:4.1.1 + A.6.5).**
These SlotKinds are stable names for signatures, substitution laws, and guard templates; they are **not** additional data slots on carriers.

| SlotKind             | ValueKind              | refMode  | Meaning |
|----------------------|------------------------|----------|---------|
| `ScopeSlot`          | `U.Scope`              | byRef    | A scope object (set of slices) owned by a carrier |
| `LeftScopeSlot`      | `U.Scope`              | byRef    | Left scope operand (binary ops/relations) |
| `RightScopeSlot`     | `U.Scope`              | byRef    | Right scope operand (binary ops/relations) |
| `ScopeFamilySlot`    | `Set[U.Scope]`          | byRef    | Finite family of scopes (for `SpanUnion`) |
| `SliceSlot`          | `U.ContextSlice`       | byValue  | A single addressable slice (membership target) |
| `SliceSetSlot`       | `ContextSliceSet`      | byRef    | A finite target set of slices (coverage target) |
| `BridgeRef`          | `U.Bridge`             | byRef    | Bridge used for `translate` / Cross‑context guards |
| `CLSlot`             | `U.CongruenceLevel`    | byValue  | Congruence Level bound in Cross‑context guards |
| `GammaTimeSlot`      | `GammaTimePolicy`      | byValue  | Explicit `Γ_time` selector/policy bound in guards |

**OperationAlgebra (USM) with SlotSpecs (normative).**

* `member(SliceSlot, ScopeSlot)` — notation form: `SliceSlot ∈ ScopeSlot`.
* `subset(LeftScopeSlot, RightScopeSlot)` — notation form: `LeftScopeSlot ⊆ RightScopeSlot`.
* `intersect(LeftScopeSlot, RightScopeSlot) → U.Scope` — notation form: `LeftScopeSlot ∩ RightScopeSlot`.
* `spanUnion(ScopeFamilySlot) → U.Scope` — notation form: `SpanUnion(ScopeFamilySlot)`.
* `translate(BridgeRef, ScopeSlot) → U.Scope` — Cross‑context mapping via Bridge.
* `widen(LeftScopeSlot, RightScopeSlot)` — Δ‑move, requires `LeftScopeSlot ⊂ RightScopeSlot`.
* `narrow(LeftScopeSlot, RightScopeSlot)` — Δ‑move, requires `RightScopeSlot ⊂ LeftScopeSlot`.
* `refit(LeftScopeSlot, RightScopeSlot)` — normalization, requires `LeftScopeSlot = RightScopeSlot`.

**Derived guard predicates (USM).**

* `coversSlice(ScopeSlot, SliceSlot) := (SliceSlot ∈ ScopeSlot)`.
* `coversSet(ScopeSlot, SliceSetSlot) := (SliceSetSlot ⊆ ScopeSlot)`.

**LawSet (USM).** Serial composition uses **intersection**; parallel publication uses **SpanUnion** only with an explicit independence justification (§7.3).

**AdmissibilityConditions (USM).** Scope coverage predicates MUST be **tri‑state** under unknowns: unknown inputs yield **unknown**, and guards MUST either (a) **abstain** (fail closed) or (b) **degrade** trust in the admitting decision via **R**; unknown MUST NOT be implicitly coerced to `false`/`0`. (See also §7.1 and §10.1.)

**Applicability (USM).** USM governs **Claim, Work, and Publication** scope objects inside a `U.BoundedContext`; coverage judgments are evaluated on explicit `U.ContextSlice` tuples (§6.1) and are not comparable or scorable as CHR values.

**Audit (USM).** Record scope‑aware decisions with the `TargetSlice` tuple, guard outcomes, and any Bridge+CL used (see §14.1).

**Transport (USM).** Cross‑context usage is **Bridge‑only** with explicit **CL**; CL penalties apply to `R_eff = R · Φ(CL)` and MUST NOT rewrite **F** or **G** (§7.4/§7.5).

**Γ_timePolicy (USM).** `Γ_time` is mandatory in slices and guards (§8.2); implicit “latest” is forbidden.

**PlaneRegime (USM).** Not applicable to set‑valued scope objects (no `CL^plane` effect on scopes).

**Mechanism specialisation (USM; A.6.1:4.2.1).** A bounded context MAY publish a specialisation of USM as either a refinement `USM′ ⊑ USM` (tighten LawSet and AdmissibilityConditions) or an extension `USM ⊑⁺ USM′` (add new operators and slots). Any such specialisation SHALL (i) name its parent (`USM`), (ii) declare the morphism kind (`⊑` vs `⊑⁺`), (iii) preserve the same RangedValueKind and SlotKinds for inherited operators (no renaming), (iv) avoid adding new mandatory inputs to inherited signatures. It MAY narrow ValueKinds or refModes monotonically and add admissibility constraints, but MUST remain substitutable for the inherited USM operators.

#### A.2.6:6.1 - `U.ContextSlice` — where scope is evaluated

**Definition.** `U.ContextSlice` is an addressable, context‑local selection of a bounded context comprising:

* **Vocabulary & roles.** The active terminology, role bindings, and local dictionaries.
* **Standards & versions.** Concrete versioned interfaces, schemas, notations, or service Standards in force.
* **Environment selectors.** Named parameters/ranges (e.g., temp, humidity, platform, jurisdiction, dataset cohort).
* **Time selector `Γ_time`.** A **mandatory** selector for the temporal frame of reference (point, window, or policy), disallowing implicit “latest”.

**Semantics.** All scope checks, guards, and compositions are evaluated **inside** an explicitly named `U.ContextSlice`. Cross‑context or cross‑slice usage MUST be mediated by a Bridge (Part B) with an explicit CL rating; see §7.4.

**Addressability.** A slice MUST be identifiable via a canonical tuple (Context, vocab‑id, Standard/version ids, env selector(s), `Γ_time`). A slice MAY be a singleton or a finite set if a guard tests multiple coherent sub‑conditions.

**Slice key (minimal).** A `U.ContextSlice` **SHALL** be addressable by a tuple containing at least: `(Context, Standard and version ids when current, environment selectors, Γ_time)`. Contexts MAY extend this tuple, for example with vocabulary ids or role-set ids.

#### A.2.6:6.2 - `U.Scope` — the abstract set‑valued scope property (USM kind; **not** a CSLC measurement)

**Definition.** `U.Scope ⊆ ContextSliceSet` is a **set‑valued USM property** whose values are sets of `U.ContextSlice` where a given statement, behavior, or capability is **fit‑for‑use**. It is **not** numeric; its internal order is the subset relation `⊆`. There is no “unit”. The primitive judgement is **membership**: `slice ∈ Scope`.

**Guard (normative).** `U.Scope`, `U.ClaimScope (G)`, `U.WorkScope`, and `U.PublicationScope` are **not** `U.Characteristic`s in the A.17/CSLC sense; do **not** include them as slots in any `U.CharacteristicSpace`, and do **not** attach normalizations/scores to them. They are **USM scope objects**.

**Operations.** USM admits:

* **Intersection `∩`** (serial composition).
* **SpanUnion** (parallel, independently supported coverage) **only when an explicit named independence assumption is declared** (features or characteristics named, validity window stated, evidence class cited). See **A.6.1/USM LawSet** for the normative template.
* **Translate** (Cross‑context mapping via Bridge).
* **Widen / Narrow** (monotone changes to the set).
* **Refit** (content‑preserving re‑expression; set equality).

**Locality.** `U.Scope` values are defined and reasoned about **context‑locally**. Translation between Contexts never occurs implicitly; see §7.4.

#### A.2.6:6.3 - `U.ClaimScope` (nick **G**) — scope of a claim (episteme)

**Carrier.** `U.Episteme` (claims, specifications, theories, policies).

**Meaning.** The set of `U.ContextSlice` where the **claim holds** as stated. This is **G** in the F–G–R triple. **G is not “abstraction level”**; it is the applicability area of the claim.

**Expression.** Authors SHALL declare Claim scope as explicit predicates or condition blocks (assumptions, parameter ranges, cohorts, platform/Standard versions, `Γ_time` windows).

**Path composition (serial).** Along any essential dependency path supporting the claim, the effective scope is the **intersection** of contributors’ Claim scopes (see §7.2). Empty intersection makes the path inapplicable.

**Parallel support.** Where **independent** lines of support justify disjoint areas, the episteme MAY publish a **SpanUnion** (see §7.3) limited strictly to the covered slices.

**Δ‑moves.**

* **ΔG+ (widen).** Replace scope S with S′ such that S ⊂ S′.
* **ΔG− (narrow).** Replace scope S with S′ such that S′ ⊂ S.
* **Refit.** Replace S with S′ where S′ = S (normalization, re‑parametrization).
* **Translate.** Map S across Contexts via a declared Bridge; CL penalties apply to **R**, not to **F/G**.

**Orthogonality.** Changes in **F** (form of expression) or **D/AT** (detail/abstraction tiers) do not change **G** unless the declared area of validity changes.

#### A.2.6:6.4 - `U.WorkScope` — scope of doing Work (capability)

**Carrier.** `U.Capability` (a system’s ability to deliver specified `U.Work`).

**Meaning.** The set of `U.ContextSlice` (conditions, Standards, platforms, operating parameters, `Γ_time`) under which the capability can **deliver the intended Work** at the declared **measures**, within declared **qualification windows**.

**Expression.** Capability owners SHALL declare **`U.WorkScope`** as explicit **conditions/constraints over `U.ContextSlice` only** (environment, platforms, Standards by version, resource regimes, `Γ_time`). Quantitative deliverables and operation windows are **not** part of the scope value:
* Declare targets as **work-measure target sets** (e.g., latency <= L, throughput >= T, tolerance <= epsilon) bound in guards (WG‑2).
* Declare inspection/recertification policies as **qualification-window policies** bound in guards (WG‑3).
The use‑time admission requires **all** of: `WorkScope covers JobSlice` **AND** `WorkMeasures satisfied` **AND** `QualificationWindow holds`.

**Method–Work gating.** A Work step’s guard MUST check that the target slice is **covered** by the capability’s Work scope **and** that required measures and qualification windows are satisfied.

**Composition and Δ‑moves.** Work scope uses the **same algebra** as Claim scope (∩ / SpanUnion / translate / widen / narrow / refit). Translation across Contexts follows §7.4.

**Separation from knowledge.** Work scope does **not** assert a proposition about the world; it asserts **deliverability** of Work under conditions. Evidence for deliverability feeds **R** (Reliability) via measurements and monitoring.

**Required guard facets (capabilities).**
* **Work-measure target set (mandatory).** A set of measurable targets with units and tolerated ranges, evaluated on the JobSlice.
* **Qualification-window policy (mandatory for operational use).** A time policy (point/window/rolling) stating when the capability is considered qualified; evaluated at `Γ_time`.
These facets are **separate** from `U.WorkScope` and live in the **R‑lane** (assurance). They MUST be referenced in Method–Work guards (see §10.3 WG‑2/WG‑3).

#### A.2.6:6.5 - `U.PublicationScope` — scope of a publication view or publication form
**Carrier.** Publication faces, publication forms, interop publication forms, cards, lanes, and MVPK faces are publication-lane objects whose renderings live on carriers; the carrier remains separate from the publication view or form.
**Meaning.** The set of `U.ContextSlice` where a **publication** (a view, card, or lane about some object or morphism) is **admissible for use** without introducing claims beyond its underlying carrier.

**Relation to other scopes (normative).**
* If the publication is **about an episteme `E`**:
  `PublicationScope(view_E) ⊆ ClaimScope(E)`.
* If the publication is **about a capability `C`**:
  `PublicationScope(view_C) ⊆ WorkScope(C)`.
* If the publication is **about a composition, crosses Contexts, or both**:
  `PublicationScope(view) ⊆ translate(Bridge, ⋂ scopes of contributors)`; CL penalties apply to **R** only (scope set membership is unaffected).

**Expression.** Authors SHALL declare `U.PublicationScope` as explicit predicates over `U.ContextSlice` (Context, Standard/version ids, environment selectors, `Γ_time`). It MAY be **narrower** than the underlying scope (e.g., due to pin availability, labeling, or audience constraints) but MUST NOT be wider.

**Algebra & Δ‑moves.** Inherits the USM algebra (∩ / SpanUnion / translate / widen / narrow / refit). **Widen** is permitted only when the underlying `U.ClaimScope`/`U.WorkScope` widens accordingly; otherwise the publication MAY refit or narrow.

**Orthogonality to measurement.** `U.PublicationScope` is a **USM scope object** (set‑valued), not a CHR Characteristic and MUST NOT appear as a slot in a `U.CharacteristicSpace`.

**View refinement (profiles).** When a stricter publication profile/view **refines** another (e.g., a typed card that requires additional pins), its `U.PublicationScope` **MUST NOT** be wider than that of the less formal view.

### A.2.6:7 - Scope Algebra

#### A.2.6:7.1 - Membership & Coverage

* **Membership judgement.** `slice ∈ Scope` is the primitive check.
* **Coverage guard.** A guard “Scope **covers** TargetSlice” means either:

  * **singleton:** `TargetSlice ∈ Scope`, or
  * **set:** `TargetSet ⊆ Scope`.
* **No implicit expansion.** Absent an explicit declaration, guards MUST NOT treat “close” slices as covered; widening requires a ΔG+ change.

**Tri‑state admissibility under unknowns (normative; aligns A.6.1).**

* If any required input to a membership/coverage check is **unknown** (missing slice selector, unknown Standard version, unmappable Bridge leg, unspecified `Γ_time`, etc.), the check result is **unknown**, not `false`.
* Guards MUST either **abstain** (fail closed) or handle the outcome under an explicit **R‑lane degradation** policy; unknown MUST NOT be coerced to `false/0`.

#### A.2.6:7.2 - Serial Composition (Intersection)

**Rule S‑INT (serial).** For an essential dependency chain `C1 → C2 → … → Ck` that supports a claim/capability, the effective scope along that chain is:

```
Scope_serial = ⋂_{i=1..k} Scope(Ci)
```

If `Scope_serial = ∅`, the chain is **inapplicable** and MUST NOT contribute to published scope.

**Monotonicity.** Adding a new essential dependency can only narrow (or leave unchanged) the serial scope.

#### A.2.6:7.3 - Parallel Support (SpanUnion)

**Rule P‑UNION (parallel).** If there exist **independent** support lines `L₁,…,Lₙ` for the **same** claim/capability, each with serial scope `S_i`, the publisher MAY declare:

```
Scope_published = SpanUnion({S_i})  =  ⋃_{i=1..n} S_i
```

**Constraints.**

* Independence MUST be justified (different support lines must not rely on the same weakest link).
* The union MUST NOT exceed the union of supported slices; “hopeful” areas are disallowed.
* Publishers SHOULD annotate coverage density/heterogeneity (informative) to aid R assessment, but numeric “coverage” is not part of G.
* **Independence criterion.** Support lines in a **SpanUnion** MUST be partitioned so that each line has a set of **essential components** disjoint from the others’ essential components (no shared weakest link). The partition (or a certificate thereof) SHALL be referenced in the publication.

#### A.2.6:7.4 - Why a **G-ladder/levels/scales** is not needed (and **must not** be introduced)

**1) G is not an ordinal scale; it is set-valued.**
Under **USM**, `U.ClaimScope` is a **set‑valued** **USM scope object** over `U.ContextSlice`. The only well‑typed primitives are **membership** and **set operations** (`⊆`, `∩`, `⋃`). Imposing ordinal “levels” such as **G0…Gk** violates the type discipline and produces non‑invariant behavior (the **same set** could be “rated” with different numbers under different heuristics). (See also LEX‑CHR‑STRICT.)

**2) G composes via `∩` / `SpanUnion`, not via `min` / `avg`.**
USM already fixes composition: along a **dependent path** use **intersection**; across **independent support lines** publish **SpanUnion**. None of these operations relies on (or preserves) any linear order. An ordinal “G ladder” invites people to take **minimums/averages**, which is **incorrect** for sets and breaks the established algebra.

**3) A G ladder drags in “abstraction level,” which is orthogonal.**
Early “G ladders” effectively encoded **abstraction/typing** (instances -> patterns -> formal classes/types -> up-to-iso). That is valuable **didactics**, but **not applicability**. We have already separated these concerns: **abstraction** is captured, if needed, by **`AbstractionTier (AT)`** as an optional facet; **applicability** is **`U.ClaimScope (G)`**.

**4) A G ladder breaks locality and Bridge semantics.**
Cross‑context transfer maps a **set** `Scope` via a **Bridge** and penalizes **R** by **CL**. There is no canonical way to “translate” an **ordinal G level** between Contexts: the mapped area may be **strictly narrower** or differently factored. Level numbers would become non‑portable, causing hidden loss or inflation of trust. With USM, we **translate sets** and keep the CL penalty where it belongs—**in R**, not in G.

**5) A G ladder duplicates ESG guards without adding decision power.**
What teams often want to “compress into a G number” is actually (a) the **quality of expression** and (b) the **completeness** of the declared scope. The first is an **F threshold** (e.g., require **`Formality >= F4`** so the scope is predicate-like and addressable); the second is handled by explicit **ESG guards**: “**Scope covers TargetSlice**,” “**`Γ_time` is specified**,” and “**freshness window holds**” (R-lane). A ladder for G adds confusion but no additional control.

**Normative directive.**
`U.ClaimScope (G)` **SHALL** remain a **set‑valued USM scope object**; **no ordinal or numeric ladder SHALL be defined** for G. If a profile needs scalar reporting, it MAY publish an explicit **report‑only** proxy **`CoverageMetric(G)`**, but **`CoverageMetric(G)` MUST NOT substitute for `G`** in norms, gates, bridge semantics, or CL routing. Authoring and gating **SHOULD** use **F thresholds** (C.2.3) and **explicit guard predicates** (A.2.6) rather than pseudo‑levels of G.

#### A.2.6:7.5 - Translation across Contexts (Bridge & CL)

**Rule T‑BRIDGE.** To use a scope in a different bounded context (room), an explicit **Bridge** MUST be declared with:

* **Mapping.** A documented mapping from source to target `U.ContextSlice` vocabulary/characteristics.
* **Congruence Level (CL).** A rating of mapping congruence.
* **Loss notes.** Any known losses, assumptions, or non‑isomorphisms.

**Effect.** The mapped scope is `T(Scope)` in the target Context. **CL penalties apply to R** (the trust in support and evidence), **not to F or G**. If mapping is coarse, the publisher SHOULD also narrow the mapped scope to the area where losses are negligible (best practice, not a requirement).

#### A.2.6:7.6 - Δ‑Operations (Widen, Narrow, Refit)

* **ΔG+ (widen).** Monotone expansion: `S ⊂ S′`. Requires new support or Bridges with sufficient declared `CL`.
* **ΔG− (narrow).** Monotone restriction: `S′ ⊂ S`. Often used to remove areas invalidated by new findings.
* **Refit.** `S′ = S` after normalization (e.g., re‑parameterization, changing units, factoring common predicates). Refit MUST NOT alter membership.

**Refit (normalization).** A refit **MUST preserve membership** exactly (S′ = S). Any change that alters boundary inclusion (due to rounding, unit conversion, discretization) is a ΔG± change, not a refit.

**Edition triggers.** Any change that alters the published set (ΔG±) is a content change and MAY trigger a new edition per Context policy (see A.2.x on editions). Refit is not a content change.

#### A.2.6:7.7 - Invariants

* **I‑LOCAL.** All scope evaluation is **context‑local**. Cross‑context usage MUST follow §7.4.
* **I‑SERIAL.** Serial scope is an **intersection**; it cannot grow by adding dependencies.
* **I‑PARALLEL.** Parallel scope MAY grow by union, but only where **independently supported**.
* **I‑WLNK.** Weakest‑link applies to **F** and **R** on dependency paths; **G** follows set rules (∩ / ⋃).
* **I‑IDS.** Idempotence: Intersecting or unioning a set with itself does not change it.
* **I‑EMPTY.** Empty scope is a first‑class value; guards MUST treat it as “not applicable”.

#### A.2.6:7.8 - Empty & Partial Scopes

* **Empty scope (`∅`).** The claim/capability is **currently not usable anywhere** in the Context; guards MUST fail.
* **Partial scope.** Publishers SHOULD avoid “global” language when actual scope is thin; instead, publish explicit slices and (informatively) coverage hints to guide R assessment.

### A.2.6:8 - Locality, Time & Version Semantics

#### A.2.6:8.1 - context‑locality

Scopes are **owned and evaluated** within a `U.BoundedContext`. State assertions (ESG/RSG) and Method–Work gates MUST NOT assume that a scope declared in another Context applies verbatim; see §7.4.

#### A.2.6:8.2 - Time selector `Γ_time`

Every scope declaration and every guard MUST specify a **`Γ_time` selector** (point, window, or policy such as “rolling 180 days”) whenever time‑dependent assumptions exist. Implicit “latest” is forbidden. When `Γ_time` differs between contributors, serial intersection resolves the overlap.

#### A.2.6:8.3 - Standards, versions & notations

Scope predicates SHALL name Standards, interfaces, or schemas **by version**. Changing symbols or notations with a faithful mapping does not change **G** (it may change **CL** for the mapping and thus affect **R**).

#### A.2.6:8.4 - Determinism of evaluation

Given fixed inputs (slice tuple, declared scope), the membership judgement MUST be deterministic. Guards SHALL fail closed (no membership ⇒ no use).

#### A.2.6:8.5 - Interaction with R (freshness & decay)

For empirical claims and operational capabilities, **R** typically binds evidence freshness windows. Scope does not decay with time; **trust in the support** does. Guards MAY combine “Scope covers” with “Evidence freshness holds” as separate predicates.

### A.2.6:9 - Lexical Discipline (Part E compliance)

**L‑USM‑1 (names).** Use **Claim scope (G)** for epistemes, **Work scope** for capabilities, and **Publication scope** for publication carriers. Use **Scope** only when discussing the abstract mechanism. Avoid naming any **characteristic** as “applicability,” “envelope,” “generality,” “capability envelope,” or “validity”.

**L‑USM‑2 (Work and Run).** Prefer **Work** and **Run** vocabulary from A.15 for system execution contexts. Do not introduce “operation” or “operating” as characteristic names; use **Work scope**.

**L‑USM‑3 (Validation).** “Validation/Validate” remain reserved for **LA** in assurance lanes (Part B). Do not name a scope object “validity”.

**L‑USM‑4 (Domain).** “Domain” is a descriptive convenience. Scopes are evaluated on **Context slices**; guards SHALL reference slices, not generic “domains”.

**L‑USM‑5 (First mention).** On first use in a Context, include the parenthetical nick: *“Claim scope (**G**)”* to preserve the F–G–R mapping.

### A.2.6:10 - Guard Patterns (ESG & Method–Work)

#### A.2.6:10.1 - Common guard shape

A scope‑aware guard has the form:

```
Guard := ScopeCoverage AND TimePolicy AND (EvidenceFreshness?) AND (BridgePolicy?)
```

**Admissibility note (normative; A.6.1 alignment).** If `ScopeCoverage` is **unknown** (due to unknown slice keys, unmappable translation, missing `Γ_time`, etc.), the guard MUST NOT silently treat this as `false`. It MUST either abstain (fail closed) or apply an explicit R‑lane degradation policy.

Where:

* **ScopeCoverage**: `Scope covers TargetSlice` (singleton or finite set), see §7.1.
* **TimePolicy**: explicit `Γ_time` selector(s); implicit “latest” is forbidden (§8.2).
* **EvidenceFreshness**: optional R‑lane freshness/decay predicates; **separate** from ScopeCoverage (§8.5).
* **BridgePolicy**: required if the Scope and TargetSlice are in **different Contexts**; declares Bridge, CL, loss notes (§7.4).

The guard **fails closed** (no membership ⇒ denial), and evaluation is **deterministic** given the slice tuple (§8.4).

#### A.2.6:10.2 - ESG guard families (epistemes)

**EG‑1 - ClaimScopeCoverage (mandatory).**
The state transition MUST include a predicate:

```
U.ClaimScope(episteme) covers TargetSlice
```

* **Singleton**: `TargetSlice ∈ ClaimScope`.
* **Finite set**: `TargetSet ⊆ ClaimScope`.

**EG‑2 - Formality threshold (if required by ESG).**
When rigor is gated, the guard MUST reference C.2.3:

```
Formality(episteme) >= F_k
```

**EG‑3 - Evidence freshness (R‑lane).**
If the state implies trust, a separate predicate MUST assert freshness windows for bound evidence:

```
Fresh(evidence, window)  AND  (NoExpiredBindings)
```

**EG‑4 - Cross‑context usage.**
If `TargetSlice.Context ≠ episteme.Context`, the guard MUST require a declared Bridge and CL:

```
Bridge(source=episteme.Context, target=TargetSlice.Context)  AND  CL ≥ c
```

> **Effect:** CL penalties apply to **R**, not to **F/G** (§7.4). The ESG guard MAY also **narrow** the mapped Claim scope when mapping losses are known.

**EG‑5 - ΔG triggers.**
If the transition publishes a **wider** Claim scope (ΔG+), the guard MUST capture the new support or the new Bridge and, if Context policy so dictates, mint a new edition (PhaseOf).

**EG‑6 - Independence for SpanUnion (when claiming parallel scope).**
When the episteme declares a **SpanUnion** across independent lines, the guard MUST include an **independence justification** (pointer to the support partition). No independence ⇒ no union.

*(Informative note.)* Managers often combine EG‑1 (coverage) + EG‑2 (F threshold) + EG‑3 (freshness) for “Effective” or “Approved” states, and EG‑4 when adopting claims across Contexts.

#### A.2.6:10.3 - Method–Work guard families (capabilities)

**WG‑1 - WorkScopeCoverage (mandatory).**
A capability can be used to deliver a Work step only if:

```
U.WorkScope(capability) covers JobSlice
```

**WG‑2 - work-measure target set satisfied** (mandatory for deliverables).
Guards MUST bind quantitative measures that the capability promises in the JobSlice:

```
SLO and target measures satisfied (latency ≤ L, throughput ≥ T, tolerance ≤ ε, … )
```

**WG‑3 - qualification-window policy holds** (mandatory for operational use).
Operational guards MUST assert that qualification windows (qualification/inspection/recert intervals) hold **at `Γ_time`**:

```
ValidityWindow(capability) holds at Γ_time
```

**WG‑4 - Cross‑context use of capability.**
If the JobSlice is in another Context:

```
Bridge(source=capability.Context, target=JobSlice.Context)  AND  CL ≥ c
```

CL penalties affect **R** (confidence in deliverability), **not** Work scope; however, the guard SHOULD narrow the mapped Work scope to account for known mapping losses.

**WG‑5 - Δ(WorkScope).**
When widening Work scope (new operating ranges/platforms), the guard MUST require evidence at the new slices (measures + qualification windows). Refit (e.g., new units/parametrization) requires no new evidence.

#### A.2.6:10.4 - Bridge‑aware guard macro (reusable)

A reusable macro for Cross‑context guards:

```
Guard_XContext(Scope, TargetSlice) :=
    exists Bridge b: (b.source = owner(Scope).Context AND b.target = TargetSlice.Context)
AND CL(b) ≥ c
AND Scope’ = translate(b, Scope)
AND Scope’ covers TargetSlice
AND (Apply CL penalty to R)
```

* **Owner(Scope).** The carrier that declares the scope: an **Episteme** (for `U.ClaimScope`), a **Capability** (for `U.WorkScope`), or a **Publication carrier** (for `U.PublicationScope`).
* **Translate(b, Scope).** The partial mapping of a set of source slices to target slices induced by Bridge **b**. If a source slice is unmappable, it is dropped. The result is a set of target slices; **CL penalties apply to R only**.
* **Penalty to R**: applied per trust calculus; F and G remain as declared.

#### A.2.6:10.5 - Selector policy (Γ\_time)

All ESG and Method–Work guards MUST spell out **`Γ_time`**:

* **Point** (“as of 2026‑03‑31T00:00Z”).
* **Window** (“rolling 180 days”).
* **Policy** (“last lab calibration within 90 days”).

Implicit “latest” is not allowed. If multiple contributors declare different policies, **serial intersection** computes the overlap (§8.2).

### A.2.6:12 - Archetypal Grounding - Worked Examples

> Each example declares the Context, the scope, the target slice, and shows the guard outcome. Where relevant, serial intersection, SpanUnion, and Bridge & CL are illustrated.

#### A.2.6:12.1 - Research claim (controlled narrative → predicate)

* **Context:** `MaterialsLab@2026`.
* **Episteme:** claim “Adhesive X retains ≥85 % tensile strength on Al6061 for 2 h at 120–150 °C.”
* **Claim scope (G):** `{substrate=Al6061, temp∈[120,150]°C, dwell≤2h, Γ_time = window(1y), rig=Calib‑v3}`.
* **Target slice:** `{substrate=Al6061, temp=140 °C, dwell=90 min, Γ_time=2026‑04‑02, rig=Calib‑v3}`.
* **Guard (EG‑1, EG‑2):** `covers(TargetSlice)` **true**; `Formality >= F4` **true** (predicates in spec).
* **Outcome:** state transition allowed (freshness checked separately under R).

#### A.2.6:12.2 - Cross‑context use of the research claim

* **target Context:** `AssemblyFloor@EU‑PLANT‑B`.
* **Bridge:** declared mapping of rigs and temp measurement correction; **CL=2** (loss: ±2 °C bias).
* **Mapped Claim scope:** `translate(Bridge, G)` narrows temp to `[122,148]°C`.
* **Guard (EG‑4):** Bridge present, `CL≥2` **true**; **R** is penalized per Φ(CL).
* **Outcome:** allowed; **G** remains the mapped set; **R** lowered.

#### A.2.6:12.3 - Capability: robotic weld Work scope

* **Context:** `RobotCell‑Weld@2026`.
* **Capability:** “Weld seam W at bead width 2.5 ± 0.3 mm, cycle ≤ 12 s.”
* **Work scope:** `{humidity<60 %, current∈[35,45]A, wire=ER70S‑6, Γ_time=rolling(90d), controller=FW‑2.1}`.
* **Job slice:** `{humidity=55 %, current=40A, wire=ER70S‑6, Γ_time=now, controller=FW‑2.1}`.
* **Guards (WG‑1..3):** coverage **true**; measures satisfied; qualification window **true** (controller certified 60 d ago).
* **Outcome:** capability admitted for this Work.

#### A.2.6:12.4 - Serial intersection (API + dataset compatibility)

* **Claim A (API Standard):** `v2.3` request schema with constraint “idempotent under retry”.
* **Claim B (Dataset cohort):** “metrics valid for cohort K with schema `ds‑14`”.
* **Composition:** service S depends on both A and B → **serial intersection** of Claim scopes: `{api=v2.3} ∩ {cohort=K, schema=ds‑14}`.
* **Target slice:** `{api=v2.3, cohort=K, schema=ds‑14}` → membership **true**.
* **Any drift (e.g., `ds‑15`)** empties the intersection ⇒ path inapplicable.

#### A.2.6:12.5 - Parallel support (SpanUnion) in a safety case

* **Line L1:** tests on **dry asphalt** support braking property; scope `S1={surface=dry, speed≤50 km/h}`.
* **Line L2:** simulations for **wet asphalt**; scope `S2={surface=wet, speed≤40 km/h}`.
* **Published scope:** `SpanUnion({S1,S2})` = `{(dry, ≤50), (wet, ≤40)}` with independence note (L1 empirical, L2 model‑validated).
* **Guard:** allowed; union does **not** include `(wet, 45)` because not supported.

#### A.2.6:12.6 - ML model deployment across Contexts

* **Model claim:** “AUC ≥ 0.92 on cohort K, pipeline P, features F, `Γ_time=rolling(180d)`.”
* **Claim scope:** `{cohort=K, pipeline=P, features=F, Γ_time=rolling(180d)}`.
* **target Context:** product `On‑Device@v7`, features `F’` (subset), pipeline `P’`.
* **Bridge:** declared mapping `F→F’`, `P→P’`, **CL=1** (notably lossy).
* **Guard:** Bridge present; `translate(G)` covers a **strict subset**; CL=1 penalizes **R** strongly; ESG requires **F≥F5** (executable semantics) and **freshness < 90 d**.
* **Outcome:** allowed only for the covered subset; adoption flagged with reduced **R**.

### A.2.6:10.1 - Bias-Annotation

USM counters three recurring biases. First, scope wording can hide a claim that the object is usable everywhere; require an addressable `U.ContextSlice` instead of a vague domain phrase. Second, abstract wording can be mistaken for wider scope; keep abstraction tier and detail separate from `U.Scope`. Third, publication convenience can be mistaken for content permission; `U.PublicationScope` bounds the publication surface and does not widen `U.ClaimScope` or `U.WorkScope`.

### A.2.6:11 - Conformance Checklist (USM)

| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑USM‑1 (Declaration).**           | Epistemes **SHALL** declare **`U.ClaimScope`**, capabilities **SHALL** declare **`U.WorkScope`**. The abstract `U.Scope` MAY be used in architectural notes but not in guards.                 |
| **CC‑USM‑2 (Set‑valued).**            | Scope objects are **set-valued** over `U.ContextSlice`. Implementations MUST support **membership**, **intersection**, **SpanUnion**, **translate**, **widen**, **narrow**, and **refit**.               |
| **CC‑USM‑3 (Coverage guards).**       | ESG and Method–Work guards **MUST** use `Scope covers TargetSlice` predicates and **MUST** specify `Γ_time`. Guards fail closed.                                                               |
| **CC‑USM‑4 (Serial intersection).**   | Along essential dependency paths, effective scope **SHALL** be the **intersection**; empty intersection invalidates the path.                                                                  |
| **CC‑USM‑5 (SpanUnion constraints).** | Parallel scope **MAY** use **SpanUnion** only if independent support lines are **justified**; published union **MUST NOT** exceed supported slices.                                            |
| **CC‑USM‑6 (Cross‑context).**            | Any Cross‑context use **MUST** declare a Bridge and **CL**; CL penalties apply to **R**, not **F/G**.                                                                                             |
| **CC‑USM‑7 (No synonym drift).**      | In normative text and guards, **MUST** use **Claim scope (G)** or **Work scope**. Terms “applicability/envelope/generality/capability envelope/validity” **MUST NOT** name the scope object.       |
| **CC‑USM‑8 (Determinism).**           | Membership evaluation **MUST** be deterministic given the slice tuple; no heuristic “close enough” matching.                                                                                   |
| **CC‑USM‑9 (Edition triggers).**      | ΔG± (widen or narrow) constitutes a **content change**; refit does not.                                                                                                                          |
| **CC‑USM‑10 (Publication discipline).** | Publication carriers that gate usage **SHALL** declare `U.PublicationScope`. For any publication **about** an episteme or capability, `PublicationScope` **MUST** be a subset of the underlying `U.ClaimScope`/`U.WorkScope`. Cross‑context publications **MUST** cite Bridge + CL; CL penalties **apply to R only** (scope membership unchanged). |
| **CC‑USM‑11 (Separation).**           | Scope coverage checks and evidence freshness or assurance checks **MUST** be separate predicates (G vs R).                                                                                        |
| **CC‑USM‑12 (Versioned Standards).**  | Scope predicates **SHALL** name Standards or interfaces by **version**; changes in notations with faithful mapping do not change **G** (may change CL for R).                                     |
| **CC‑USM‑13 (Min‑info publication).** | Published scopes **SHOULD** enumerate slices or predicate blocks sufficient to re‑evaluate membership without external folklore.                                                               |
| **CC‑USM‑14 (Slot discipline).**      | Where USM operations/guards are referenced in signatures or templates, they **SHALL** use explicit SlotSpecs and obey the A.6.5 lexical discipline (`…Slot` for SlotKinds; `…Ref` only for RefKinds/refs). |
| **CC‑USM‑15 (Unknown handling).**     | Membership/coverage evaluation MUST be tri‑state under unknown inputs: unknown → {abstain (fail closed) \| degrade via R}; unknown MUST NOT be coerced to `false/0`. |

### A.2.6:13.3 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti‑pattern                                    | Why it’s wrong                   | Fix                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| “Latest” time by default                        | Non‑deterministic; violates §8.2 | Declare `Γ_time` explicitly as a point, window, or policy          |
| Using “domain” in guards                        | Not addressable; hides slices    | Replace with concrete `U.ContextSlice` tuples              |
| Treating “more abstract wording” as wider scope | Abstraction ≠ applicability      | Keep **AT/D** separate; widen **G** only with explicit ΔG+ |
| Publishing union without independence           | Overstates coverage              | Justify independence or publish serial intersection only   |
| Cross‑context use without Bridge                   | Silent semantic drift            | Require Bridge + CL; apply **R** penalties                 |

### A.2.6:11.1 - Consequences

A correct USM use makes scope checks reproducible: every membership claim points to a slice, every cross-context reuse names the Bridge and CL loss, and every widening or narrowing changes the declared scope rather than the word around it. The cost is explicitness: a project must name context versions, environment selectors, and `Γ_time` before a guard can admit the claim, work, or publication use.

### A.2.6:13 - Playbooks (Informative)

#### A.2.6:13.1 - Manager’s 6‑step adoption checklist

1. **Name the TargetSlice.** Write the tuple (Context, versions, environment params, `Γ_time`).
2. **Check scope coverage.** “Claim scope or Work scope covers TargetSlice?” If **no**, either **ΔG+** (publish wider scope with support) or **decline**.
3. **Check rigor if gated.** If ESG requires it, ensure `Formality >= F_k`.
4. **Check evidence freshness (R).** Validate windows and decay policies; do not conflate with coverage.
5. **Bridge if Cross‑context.** Require declared Bridge, CL, and loss notes; accept **R** penalties.
6. **Record the decision.** Keep the slice and guard outcomes with the StateAssertion (auditability).

#### A.2.6:13.2 - Architect’s design rubric for scopes

* **Prefer predicates over prose.** Name parameters, ranges, Standards by **version**, and `Γ_time`.
* **Factor common conditions.** Use Refit to normalize units and factor shared predicates; do not widen by stealth.
* **Partition support lines.** If you plan a **SpanUnion**, document independence up front.
* **Keep scope thin & honest.** Publish what you can support; add slices as support appears (ΔG+).
* **Design Bridges early.** When interop is planned, sketch mapping characteristics and **expected CL**; plan **R** penalties.

#### A.2.6:13.4 - Minimal DSL snippet for scope blocks (illustrative)

```
claimScope:
  Context: MaterialsLab@2026
  Standards:
    - rig: Calib-v3
    - api: v2.3
  env:
    substrate: Al6061
    temp: [120, 150] # °C
    dwell: { max: "2h" }
  gamma_time: { window_days: 365 }
```

*(Illustrative only; the specification does not mandate a particular syntax.)*

#### A.2.6:13.5 - Profiles as Scope configurations (informative)
**Idea.** A **Scope profile** is a **named, editioned configuration** that expands to a concrete `U.Scope` predicate block (over `U.ContextSlice`), used to avoid repetition and to keep declarations consistent across carriers.

**Rules.**
* **P1 (Expansion).** Profiles are macros: guards **MUST** expand them to explicit predicates before evaluating `Scope covers TargetSlice`.
* **P2 (Edition).** Profiles are editioned; changing a profile’s predicates is a content change for any carrier that references it.
* **P3 (No stealth widen).** A profile update MUST NOT implicitly widen a carrier’s published scope; ΔG+ must be explicit in that carrier.
* **P4 (Bridge awareness).** If a profile implies Cross‑context use, it MUST name the Bridge and CL policy; CL penalties apply to **R** only.
* **P5 (Locality).** Profiles are context‑local conveniences; they do not introduce new scope types.

**Examples (illustrative).**
— An engineering context defines `Ops‑Lab‑v3` as a profile pinning Standards, environment selectors, and a rolling `Γ_time` policy; claims, capabilities, and publications may reference it as a shorthand.
— A publication stack defines `TechCard‑Lite@Σ` as a profile that **narrows** `U.PublicationScope` to slices where required pins are available.

### A.2.6:14 - Governance Hooks & Audits

#### A.2.6:14.1 - Governance metadata (normative)

Contexts that adopt USM SHALL record, per scope‑aware decision:

* **Owner.** Episteme (for Claim scope) or Capability (for Work scope).
* **TargetSlice tuple.** Context, vocabulary and role-set ids when current, versioned Standards, environment selectors, **`Γ_time`**.
* **Guard outcomes.** Membership result, Bound measures (for Work scope), Freshness predicates (R).
* **Bridge info (if any).** Mapping summary, **CL**, loss notes, applied R penalty.
* **ΔG log.** Widen/narrow/refit; edition policy outcome.

#### A.2.6:14.2 - USM compliance levels (informative)

* **USM‑Ready.** Context declares adoption; editors trained; lexicon updated.
* **USM‑Guarded.** All ESG and Method–Work guards use Claim scope or Work scope and `Γ_time`.
* **USM‑Auditable.** Decision records include TargetSlice tuples and Bridge and CL details.
* **USM‑Composed.** Serial intersection and SpanUnion are implemented in composition tooling.

#### A.2.6:14.3 - Audit checklist (informative)

* Does each guard **name** a concrete **TargetSlice**?
* Is **membership** deterministically recomputable from published predicates?
* Are **freshness** and **coverage** separate predicates?
* For Cross‑context use: is there a **Bridge** with **CL** and loss notes?
* For parallel support: is **independence** justified?

#### A.2.6:14.4 - Risk controls (informative)

* **Silent widening.** Require ΔG+ review; flag any scope increase without new support or Bridge.
* **Opaque slices.** Disallow “domain” placeholders; enforce addressable selectors.
* **Time drift.** Require `Γ_time` policies (rolling windows) for time‑sensitive scopes.

### A.2.6:16 - Extended FAQ (informative)

**Q1. Is “Claim scope” the same as “domain”?**
**No.** “Domain” is descriptive and often fuzzy. **Claim scope** is **addressable**: it names concrete `U.ContextSlice` conditions and a **`Γ_time`** policy. Guards MUST reference slices, not generic “domains”.

**Q2. How do we express partial coverage across different cohorts or platforms?**
Declare each supported serial scope (`S₁, S₂, …`) and publish **SpanUnion({Sᵢ})** with independence justification. Do **not** include unsupported slices.

**Q3. Can raising F (formalizing) widen G?**
Only if the formalization **explicitly changes** the scope predicates (ΔG+). Formalization alone does not widen scope.

**Q4. What is the difference between Work scope and SLOs?**
**Work scope** is **where** the capability can deliver; **measures** within the guard are **what** it promises there (SLO targets). Both are required at use time (WG‑1..3).

**Q5. Can we assign numeric coverage to G?**
Not normatively. G is set‑valued. You MAY attach an **informative**, explicitly declared **`CoverageMetric(G)`** (e.g., a proportion under a pinned policy) to aid **R** assessment, but guards use set membership and **`CoverageMetric(G)` MUST NOT replace `G`**.

**Q6. How do we handle “latest data” scopes?**
You don’t. Declare a **`Γ_time`** policy (e.g., rolling 90 days). “Latest” is forbidden to ensure reproducible evaluation.

**Q7. How do we move a scope to another Context?**
Declare a **Bridge** with **CL** and loss notes; compute `translate(Bridge, Scope)`; apply CL penalty to **R**; consider narrowing the mapped set.

**Q8. What about abstraction level or detail?**
Keep **AT (AbstractionTier)** and **D (Detail and Resolution)** as orthogonal, optional annotations. They never substitute for **Claim scope** or **Work scope**.

**Q9. Can a capability’s Work scope be broader than a predecessor claim’s Claim scope on a dependency path?**
They are on different carriers. In a serial dependency, the **effective** scope is the **intersection**; the broader one does not dominate.

**Q10. When does an empty scope make sense?**
It indicates “not usable anywhere (here, now)”. Guards MUST fail. This is common during early drafting or after a refutation.

*(Use these source terms only in explanatory notes; not in guards or conformance text.)*

#### A.2.6:17.2 - Minimal data model hints

**ContextSlice tuple (suggested keys):**
`Context`, `vocabId`, `rolesetId?`, `Standards: [{name, version}]`, `env: {param: range/value}`, `gamma_time: {point|window|policy}`.

**Claim scope block:**
`assumptions`, `cohorts`, `platforms/Standards`, `env`, `gamma_time`.

**Work scope block:**
`conditions (env/platform/Standards)`, `measures (targets & units)`, `validity_windows`, `gamma_time`.

*(These are informative; the spec does not mandate a concrete serialization.)*

#### A.2.6:18.3 - Pseudocode membership (illustrative)

```python
def covers(scope: Set[Slice], target: Union[Slice, Set[Slice]]) -> bool:
    if isinstance(target, Slice):
        return target in scope
    return target.issubset(scope)
```

### A.2.6:17.4 - Rationale

A.2.6 needs a scope mechanism because scope is neither evidence freshness nor expression rigor: it is the set-valued condition under which a claim, work capability, or publication surface may be used. The rationale for USM is to make those membership conditions addressable, composable, and reopenable while preserving the F/G/R separation and Bridge+CL discipline.

### A.2.6:17.4.0 - SoTA-Echoing - F-Cluster Unification for A.2.6 (F.17 and F.18)

> **Intent.** This annex applies the **F‑cluster method** to triangulate **USM** terms against a diverse set of post‑2015 sources and communities (“Contexts”), and then fixes the **Unified Tech** and **Plain** names used in A.2.6. Results are ready for downstream lexicon entries (Part E) and guard templates (ESG / Method–Work).

#### A.2.6:17.4.1 - F.17 Unified Term Survey (UTS) — Method & Scope

**Contexts surveyed (SoTA, diverse):**

1. **ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010** (architecture description)
2. **OMG Essence** (Kernel: Alphas, Work Products, States)
3. **NIST AI RMF 1.0/1.1** (trustworthy AI)
4. **ASME V\&V 40–2018 / FDA 2021–2023** (model credibility)
5. **W3C SHACL (2017+) / SHACL‑AF** (data constraints)
6. **OWL 2 / ontology engineering (2012+, current practice)**
7. **IETF BCP 14 (RFC 2119/8174)** (normative keywords & guard style)
8. **DO‑178C + DO‑333** (avionics, formal methods supplement)
9. **ISO 26262:2018/2025** (automotive functional safety)
10. **IEC 61508 (2010+, current revisions)** (basic safety)
11. **ACM Artifact Review & Badging v1.1** (reproducibility signals)
12. **MLOps/Cloud SLO practice (SRE / platform)** (operational guardrails)

**Survey focus (terms we align):** `U.ContextSlice`, generic **Scope** and set algebra, **Claim scope (G)**, **Work scope**, **Bridge and CL**, **Γ\_time**, **widen**, **narrow**, **refit**, **translate**, **SpanUnion**, **serial intersection**, separation from **F** and **R**, and avoidance of overloaded **validity** and **operation** terms.

Credibility/evidence freshness contribute to **R**, not to G; USM keeps them separate in guards.                                                       |

**Summary.** Across all Contexts, two stable notions recur: (1) **evaluate in a concrete context** (→ `U.ContextSlice`), and (2) **declare where something holds or is deliverable** (→ set‑valued **Scope**). “Context of use,” “operating modes,” “targets,” “class extension,” and “OSED” are all Context‑flavored presentations of **Claim scope** or **Work scope**. Terms like *validity* and *operation* are semantically close but collide with **LA** and FPF’s **Work** and **Run** lexicon; we therefore **do not** adopt them as characteristic names.

**Why these names (decision grounds):**

* **“Scope” wins over “envelope/applicability/validity”.** It is short, **self‑documenting**, and already idiomatic in SRE/SW, while “validity” clashes with **Validation Assurance (LA)** and “envelope” suggests geometry, not **membership**.
* **“Claim scope” vs “Work scope”.** Two‑word compounds meet the FPF clarity rule: the first token reveals the **carrier** (Claim vs Work/Capability), the second the **mechanism** (scope).
* **Keep **G**.** The F–G–R triple is canonical; we retain **G** as nickname for **Claim scope**.
* **“Context slice”** is the only term that makes the evaluation target **addressable** (Context, versions, params, **Γ\_time**).
* **“Operation”, “operating”, and “validity” avoided.** They are **overloaded** in existing FPF lanes (Work, Run, and LA) and create policy ambiguities in guards.

##### A.2.6:17.4.3.2 - Phrasebook (for editors, normative)

* Use **“Claim scope (G) covers TargetSlice”** and **“Work scope covers JobSlice”** in guards.
* Always spell **`Γ_time`**; never say “latest”.
* To compose, say: **“intersection along dependency paths; SpanUnion across independent support lines.”**
* For Cross‑context use, say: **“via Bridge; CL penalties apply to R (trust), not to F/G (content/scope).”**
* When widening/narrowing, write **“ΔG+ / ΔG−”** and log the support change; use **“Refit”** for unit/param normalization.

##### A.2.6:17.4.3.3 - Rosetta summary (informative, for rationale box)

| local context phrase                          | Use in USM wording                                          |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| “Context of use” (NIST, ASME/FDA)          | **Claim scope (G)** on explicit **Context slice**           |
| “Operating modes/situations” (ISO 26262)   | **Work scope** with measures & qualification windows             |
| “Target (class/shape)” (SHACL/OWL)         | **Claim scope predicates** (membership)                     |
| “Architecture view context” (42010)        | **Context slice** + **Scope** checks inside the view        |
| “Capability envelope” (safety documents) | **Work scope**                                              |
| “Domain” (informal)                        | **Context slice** elements; not acceptable as a guard input |

**Outcome.** The UTS shows clear convergence across SoTA Contexts on **addressable context** and **set‑valued applicability**. F.18 therefore fixes: **Context slice**, **Scope**, **Claim scope (G)**, **Work scope**, **Publication scope** with the algebra and guard clauses mandated in A.2.6. This closes synonym drift while remaining readable for engineering managers and precise for assurance tooling.

### A.2.6:15 - Relations - Cross-Pattern Coordination

#### A.2.6:15.1 - With F–G–R (C.2.2)

* **G is Claim scope.** Use set algebra (∩ / SpanUnion).
* **F** remains the expression rigor (C.2.3); **R** captures evidence freshness and CL penalties.
* **Weakest‑link.** On dependency paths: **F\_composite = min(F)**, **R\_composite = min(R)**; **G** follows §7.2–§7.3 (set rules).

#### A.2.6:15.2 - With Formality (C.2.3)

* **No conflation.** Raising **F** does not change **G** unless scope predicates change.
* **Guarding rigor.** ESG may use `Formality >= F_k` alongside scope coverage.

#### A.2.6:15.3 - With Work & Run (A.15)

* **Work scope** aligns with the **execution context** of `U.Work`.
* Method–Work gates use **Work scope coverage** plus **measures** and **qualification windows**.

#### A.2.6:15.4 - With Bridges & CL (Part B)

* **CL only impacts R.** CL penalties reduce trust; they never rewrite **F** or **G**.
* **Best practice.** Narrow mapped scopes where mapping losses are material.

#### A.2.6:15.5 - With Capability governance (A.2.2)

* Capabilities MUST declare **Work scope**, **measures**, **qualification windows**; gates MUST verify all three.
* Capability refits that preserve the set (unit changes) are **Refit**, not Δ(WorkScope).

### A.2.6:End
